    The beautiful Kashmir region is resplendent with white beauty in winter and the colors of nature in the autumn / fall, spring and summers. It is truly a ‘Paradise on Earth’ as it is called.

    Once you step into the wonderful region, you will definitely wonder if you’re on the earth or you are looking straight at a huge picture postcard.
    
    The waters of the Himalayas are so still and the mountains in the backdrop makes it one of the most picturesque places on this planet.
    
    It makes the waters look silvery with a sheen that turns golden when the first sun rays reflect on these waters.
    
    In the far sight, you can see the Great mountain ranges covered in mist and clouds while they merge into each other forming a ‘crest’. The deciduous gigantic Chinar trees found all over the valley coloring the streets with shades of yellow and red streaks especially during the pleasant autumn climate.
    
    The leaves fall down on the ground making the streets soft to step on and almost turning the ground to yellow. This beautiful Paradise on Earth would definitely connect you with the nature.
